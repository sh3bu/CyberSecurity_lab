## 1. Understand the architecture of Splunk and the installation process. Setup collector and forwarder, then ensure the logs are accumulated in Splunk. Familiarize yourself with the dashboard fields.

**Installation -**

**Forward all logs to splunk enterprise which is located in our windows machine -**

**Use splunk add monitor to add the location of log files to be forwarded -**

**Start apache server to test and ensure if logs are being forwarded**

Thus from the below screenshot we can confirm that our logs are being forwarded.

## 2. Run Splunk >> Forwarder can be in the same system or another system (user’s convenience)
>>Make sure the logs are indexing in the Splunk enterprise.

```
• Run any network and port scanning commands from the host to the target machine.
Run at least 5 to 8 commands. (If required, any tools can also be used).

• Use the search section in Splunk to analyze the firewall logs to find the log of the above
process and the exact IP from where the scan was performed. HINT: Use the “stats”
command.

• Analyze the log file and create an alert for any further similar activities.
```

**Add thr location of folder where nmap log files are stored -**

**Run nmap command on linux system - **

**Perform search query**

## 3. Run Splunk >> Forwarder can be in the same system or another system (user’s convenience)

>>Make sure the logs are indexing in the Splunk enterprise.

```

• Perform any communication using unencrypted traffic.

• Use the Splunk search section to check the firewall logs to analyze which application
uses unencrypted data.

• Analyze the log file and create an alert for any further similar activities.
```
**Visit any unencrypted website to produce traffic -**

**Search query to identify the website visited =**

## 4. Run Splunk >> Forwarder can be in the same system or another system (user’s convenience)

>>Make sure the logs are indexing in the Splunk enterprise. Download malware from this site


```
https://dasmalwerk.eu/ . CAUTION: THEY ARE REAL MALWARE. USE IN AN ISOLATED
ENVIRONMENT. >> Run the malware in your target system.

• After running your malware file, either it is stopped by your antivirus or not using the
search section, find the antivirus log for the past 1 hour.

• Run different malware files again in the same target system and use the search section
to find the time range between the previous and current malware file execution. HINT:
Use the “stats” command.

• Then save that search as an alert to show a notification when the same type happens
again.
```

## 5. Run Splunk >> Forwarder can be in the same system or another system (user’s convenience)

>>Make sure the logs are indexing in the Splunk enterprise.


```

• Logout of the target system and perform multiple failed attempts. Then use the search
section to filter out the failed attempt logs. Hint: Use the “stats” command.

• Analyze the log file and create an alert for any further similar activities
```

**Perform incorrect login attempts to trigger the error log & confirm it is captured in the splunk enterprise - **

**Enter correct credentials while logging in and view that in splunk -**
