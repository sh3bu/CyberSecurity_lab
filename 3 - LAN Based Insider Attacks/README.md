# LAN based insider attacks


Make use of Ettercap/arpspoof tool to perform ARP Cache Poisoning based attacks in a LAN
environment:

1. Perform Password stealing (over plaintext) using ARP Cache Poisoning attacks


2. Perform Denial of Service (DoS) attacks using ARP Cache Poisoning attacks


3. Perform DNS Spoofing attack using ARP Cache Poisoning attacks


4. Invoke ‘sslstrip tool’ for stealing passwords from any machine that is connected to a LAN by
stripping the HTTPS connection.

5. Use arp_cop and scan_poisoner plugins to learn about the detection of ARP attacks.


Observe the ARP cache table, CAM table, etc., before and after the attack for all the above attacks. Run
Wireshark and observe the traffic patterns before and after the attack
